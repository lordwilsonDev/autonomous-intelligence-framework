# The Convergence of Autonomic Intelligence
## A Comprehensive Analysis of the Agentic Stack in Late 2025

### Executive Summary

By the fourth quarter of 2025, the artificial intelligence landscape has undergone a structural transformation from the "Probabilistic Era" to the "Autonomic Era." This document provides the complete technical analysis of how Multi-Agent Orchestration, Hybrid Model Routing, Agentic Memory, Open Agentic Platforms, and Event-Driven Infrastructure converged to create truly autonomous intelligence systems.

**Key Finding**: The barrier to AI deployment is no longer model quality but **Orchestration Engineering** - the ability to design, govern, and optimize complex meshes of agents, events, and data streams.
